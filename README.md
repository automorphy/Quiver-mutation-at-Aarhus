This is collaboration on Quiver Mutation at the Aarhus workshop.

The folder decision tree contains two files:
- decision_tree.py which contains the definition of the decision tree
- A notebook that evaluates the decision tree (for this, you will need the data from Experiment 4 in: https://github.com/KTKAW/MACHINE_LEARNING_MUTATION_ACYCLICITY_OF_QUIVERS)
